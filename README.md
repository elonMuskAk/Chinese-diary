华为作为一家中国高科技公司，身为中国人我曾感到自豪，很多公司都想学华为，狼性文化，奋斗精神，加班文化等，除了增加加班作秀外，这种加量不加薪酬的模式，让我们有苦说不说，司法的不公，让我们弱势群体无处投诉，自此我不再购买华为任何产品，从我做起.


Huawei is a Chinese high-tech company. As a Chinese, I have been proud of myself. Many companies want to learn from Huawei, its wolf culture, fighting spirit, overtime culture, etc. In addition to increasing overtime for show, this model of increasing work without increasing salary , let us not talk about our sufferings, the injustice of the judiciary, leaving our vulnerable groups nowhere to complain. From now on, I will no longer buy any Huawei products, starting from me.

让我来聊中国证券市场
Let me talk about the Chinese securities market


我带着对市场的憧憬和对国家的信心入市，却在一次次的亏损和失望中，逐渐意识到自己的错误:我忽略了，普通投资者面对的是一个几乎无力抗衡的市场规则,我未曾警惕，一些公司的业绩公告和财务数据可能是虚假的，很多所谓的“蓝筹股”不过是包装出来的“伪优质”,我低估了政策的不确定性对市场的冲击，忘记了中国股市从一开始就是一个特殊的“政策市”，验教训告诉我，中国股市并不适合普通人投资，它是一个高风险、低回报的场所
人想通过股市实现财富增长，无异于把自己送进一场精心设计的局，这是一个合法诈骗市场。

I entered the market with a longing for the market and confidence in the country, but in the repeated losses and disappointments, I gradually realized my mistake: I ignored that ordinary investors are faced with a market rule that they are almost unable to compete with. I have not been alert to the fact that some companies' performance announcements and financial data may be false. Many so-called "blue chip stocks" are just packaged "pseudo-quality". I underestimated the impact of policy uncertainty on the market, and forgot that the Chinese stock market has been a special "policy market" from the beginning. Experience and lessons have taught me that, The Chinese stock market is not suitable for ordinary people to invest. It is a place of high risk and low return.
If people want to achieve wealth growth through the stock market, they are tantamount to sending themselves into a well-designed game. This is a legal fraud market.

在参与股市的过程，我逐渐认识到，中国证券市场，并不如宣传那样，制度设计的缺陷，创业板和科创板，准入机制宽松，欺诈发行，内幕交易，财务造假，违法减持，操作纵股价等行为盛行，处罚力度过轻，对于上亿违法利润，执法机构，几十万，上百万的罚款，别人根本不在乎，证监会也只有发文通报批评，这些人，竟然没有受到刑事处法，我甚至怀疑有人故意而为之，市场投机盛行，投资回报低下，很多上市公司老板，其实就是为了套现离场。

In the process of participating in the stock market, I gradually realized that the Chinese securities market is not as advertised, with flaws in the system design, the GEM and the Science and Technology Innovation Board, the public access mechanism, fraudulent issuance, insider trading, financial fraud, and illegal deductions. Behaviors such as holding and manipulating stock prices are prevalent, and the punishment has been relaxed. For hundreds of millions of illegal profits, Run, law enforcement agencies, and fines of hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars, others don't care at all. The China Securities Regulatory Commission can only issue a notice to criticize. These people have not been punished by justice. I even suspect that someone has conspired to do it. Market speculation is prevalent. , under the low return on investment, many bosses of listed companies actually leave the market to cash out.

基金公司本应起到稳定市场作用，但他拿着广大购买基金的钱，购买股票，再通过出借，让别人做空自家公司购买的股票，目的就是收取基金管理费，基金购买者为了摊溥成本，只能追加资金，基金循环往复，基金购买者苦不堪言，更有基金经理运营亏损40%以上，基金经理奖金，薪资不减反增，这是很不道德的.

Fund companies are supposed to follow the role of stabilizing the market, but they control most of the money to buy funds, buy stocks, and then lend them to others to short-sell the stocks purchased by their own companies. The purpose is to collect fund management fees. In order to spread the costs, fund buyers The only option is to add additional funds, and the fund cycle goes on and on, making fund buyers miserable. In addition, the fund manager's operating loss is more than 40%, and the fund manager's bonus and fund salary increase instead of decreasing. This is very unethical.



中国股市不具备一个健康市场所应有的基础条件，它不是一个普通人能够公平参与的地方,如果你想要投资，请考虑全球更加成熟的市场，比如美股、港股，或者其也更透明、更稳定的投资渠道。

The Chinese stock market does not have the basic conditions for a healthy market. It is not a place where ordinary people can participate fairly. If you want to invest, please consider more mature markets in the world, such as US stocks and Hong Kong stocks, or they are more transparent and More stable investment channels.
