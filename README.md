华为作为一家中国高科技公司，身为中国人我曾感到自豪，很多公司都想学华为，狼性文化，奋斗精神，加班文化等，除了增加加班作秀外，这种加量不加薪酬的模式，让我们有苦说不说，司法的不公，让我们弱势群体无处投诉，自此我不再购买华为任何产品，从我做起.


Huawei is a Chinese high-tech company. As a Chinese, I have been proud of myself. Many companies want to learn from Huawei, its wolf culture, fighting spirit, overtime culture, etc. In addition to increasing overtime for show, this model of increasing work without increasing salary , let us not talk about our sufferings, the injustice of the judiciary, leaving our vulnerable groups nowhere to complain. From now on, I will no longer buy any Huawei products, starting from me.
